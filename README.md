# Strikeout-Predictions
A regression model to identify the most important pitching statistics to predict the number of strikeouts a pitcher will throw in 1 season. 


## Abstract
Major League Baseball is an American professional sports league with thirty individual teams located across the country. The pitcher starts every play in baseball, making them a key part in the team’s defense. The pitcher’s job is to throw the ball to the batter and try to get the batter out. Pitchers can record outs via strikeout. Major League Baseball teams search for pitchers who record a high number of strikeouts in a game, which makes it more difficult for the other team to score runs. With analytics being used more in sports, Major League Baseball teams are collecting data to evaluate pitchers. To help a baseball team win more games, analyzing pitching data to find which statistics result in more strikeouts can help teams identify which pitchers they want to recruit to their team. We propose a polynomial regression model that uses the most relevant pitching statistics to predict the number of strikeouts in a single season. Our findings indicate the most important statistics to predict strikeouts are innings pitched, walks per 9 innings, and the strikeout to walk ratio.
